				<p><span id="paragraph4">My mom asked me a question, which I liked better, cats or dogs?  I said cats because they have 9 lives and are cuter.  Thinking back, I think all animals deserve 9 lives and all of them are cuter.  I would like to be a Veterinarian when I grow-up so I can spend time with and help animals.  My cat, Sega, is a Main Coon and he loves to be brushed and fed treats.  I also have a dog named, Asia, at my daddy's house.  She is all black and loves to play and jump on me.  I can draw owls really well.  They are one of my many favorite animals.
