My page is all about my life and the things that matter most.  Spending time with mom and dad, swimming in the summertime, and sleeping-in are just a few things that are dear to me.  I started 2nd grade at a new school this year and at first didnâ€™t want to go, but after the first day loved it!  Mrs. Morris is my teacher and she is really nice.  I am learning new stuff in my classes and making new friends.  My closest friend, Pilar, and I became friends on the first day of school.  She brought in the cutest kitty cat toy and let me play with it at recess.  Now we play together every day.<br><br>
